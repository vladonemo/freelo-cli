Initial scaffold of the Freelo CLI: TypeScript + ESM project skeleton, build via tsup, ESLint 9 flat config, Prettier, Vitest with v8 coverage and MSW wired in, Husky + lint-staged + commitlint enforcing Conventional Commits, Changesets for release management, and GitHub Actions CI matrix on Node 20/22 across Linux/macOS/Windows. Ships a single `freelo` binary that responds to `freelo --version` (and `-V`) by printing the package version.
